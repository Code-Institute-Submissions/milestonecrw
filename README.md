This is the website I have created for Combat Ready Wrestling, A section of Combat Ready gym Edinburgh. To provide the user with information of what martial arts are on offer and a means of contact.
I have done this by creating a 6 page website, with a home page, a page for each martial art on offer, a contact form and page providing useful links.
